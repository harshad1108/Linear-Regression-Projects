# 📊 Brand Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical brand sales data and building a **Linear Regression model** to predict future sales. The aim is to understand sales patterns and identify key factors influencing brand performance using data-driven techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on brand sales data  
- Identify important features affecting sales  
- Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model  
- Visualize sales trends and predictions  
- Derive meaningful business insights

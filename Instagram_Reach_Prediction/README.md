# Instagram Engagement Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict Instagram post engagement (likes or engagement score) based on post and account-related features using Linear Regression.

## 📊 Dataset
Source: Public Instagram analytics dataset  
The dataset includes information related to post reach, impressions, followers, and posting activity.

## 🧮 Features
- followers_count  
- impressions  
- reach  
- hashtag_count  
- post_frequency  

## 🎯 Target Variable
- likes / engagement_score  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 🔍 Approach
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection  
5. Train-test split  
6. Linear Regression model training  
7. Model evaluation  

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score  

## 🚀 Business Impact
Helps content creators and marketers understand which factors influence engagement and optimize posting strategies to improve reach and interaction.

## 📌 Conclusion
Linear Regression provides valuable insights into how different Instagram metrics impact engagement, making it useful for social media analytics and growth strategies.
